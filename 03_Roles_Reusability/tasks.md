# Phase 03 — Roles & Reusability

## Before you start — be comfortable with:

- Everything from Phase 01 and Phase 02
- The static vs dynamic concept from Phase 02 (`import_tasks` vs `include_tasks`) — the same idea applies to `import_role` vs `include_role` which you'll use in this phase
- What `group_vars` and `host_vars` are and how they relate to variable precedence
- What a handler is (from Phase 02) — roles have their own handlers directory

Do not start this phase if Phase 02 concepts still feel unclear. Roles are where everything from the first two phases comes together.

---

## What this phase covers

How production Ansible projects are actually structured. Every company that uses Ansible beyond basic scripts uses roles. If you cannot describe role structure and the `defaults` vs `vars` distinction clearly, your resume claim will not hold up in an interview.

## Folder structure to build as you go

```
03_Roles_Reusability/
  inventory/
    inventory.yml
    group_vars/
      all.yml
  roles/
    common/
      tasks/main.yml
      defaults/main.yml
      meta/main.yml
    webserver/
      tasks/
        main.yml
        install.yml
        configure.yml
      handlers/main.yml
      templates/
        nginx.conf.j2
      files/
        index.html
      defaults/main.yml
      vars/main.yml
      meta/main.yml
    app_deploy/
      tasks/main.yml
      defaults/main.yml
  ansible.cfg
  site.yml
  webservers.yml
  requirements.yml
```

Build this by hand as you work through exercises. Do not create the whole structure upfront.

## Concepts to Master

---

### 1. Role directory structure — every directory has a purpose

| Directory             | Purpose                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tasks/main.yml`    | entry point — Ansible runs this when the role is called               |
| `tasks/install.yml` | convention: split big task files by concern,`import_tasks` from main |
| `handlers/main.yml` | handlers scoped to this role only                                      |
| `templates/`        | Jinja2`.j2` template files                                           |
| `files/`            | static files copied as-is (no templating)                              |
| `defaults/main.yml` | lowest-precedence variables — overridable public interface            |
| `vars/main.yml`     | high-precedence internal constants — not meant to be overridden       |
| `meta/main.yml`     | role metadata: author, Galaxy info, dependency list                    |
| `library/`          | custom modules scoped to this role only                                |

Only `tasks/` is required. All other directories are optional. Ansible automatically reads `main.yml` from each directory — you do not import it manually.

**Exercise — Create the webserver role:**

> **Important — scope of role variables**: Variables defined in `defaults/main.yml` and `vars/main.yml` are only available **inside that role's own tasks**. They do not exist in playbook-level `tasks:` blocks unless the role has been called. `site.yml` should only call the role — the tasks that USE the variables live inside the role files.

- Create the full directory structure for the `webserver` role manually (no shortcuts)
- `tasks/main.yml`: use `import_tasks` to call `install.yml` and `configure.yml`
  - `tasks/install.yml`: a debug task that prints `"Installing nginx on port {{ http_port }}"`
  - `tasks/configure.yml`: a debug task that prints `"Configuring nginx — worker user: {{ nginx_user }}"`
- `handlers/main.yml`: a handler that prints `"Nginx restarted"`
- `defaults/main.yml`: set `http_port: 80` and `server_name: "localhost"`
- `vars/main.yml`: set `nginx_user: "www-data"`
- Write `site.yml` that calls the webserver roles using localhost
  - `site.yml`: a single play targeting `localhost` with only a `roles:` key calling `webserver` — no inline `tasks:` here
  - Run it. Verify both debug messages print with the correct values from `defaults/` and `vars/`

---

### 2. `defaults` vs `vars` — the most misunderstood concept in roles

This is a critical interview topic.

**`defaults/main.yml`:**

- Lowest variable precedence of everything in Ansible
- The role's overridable public interface
- Think of it as: *"I set a sane default, but you are expected to override this"*
- Any inventory variable, `group_var`, `host_var`, or playbook `vars:` overrides defaults

**`vars/main.yml`:**

- Very high variable precedence — higher than `group_vars` and `host_vars`
- Internal constants the role needs to function
- Think of it as: *"This is how this role works — do not change this from outside"*

**Interview answer: `defaults/` is the role's public API. `vars/` is its private internals.**

**Exercise — Prove the precedence difference:**

- In the webserver role: `defaults/main.yml` has `http_port: 80`, `vars/main.yml` has `nginx_user: "www-data"`
- In your playbook `vars:` section, try to override BOTH: `{http_port: 8080, nginx_user: "myuser"}`
- Add debug tasks to print both variables. Run it.
- Which one changed? Which stayed as defined in the role? # Only http_port changes
- Now try overriding `nginx_user` via `group_vars/all.yml` instead. Which wins: group_vars or `vars/main.yml`? # `vars/main.yml` wins
- Write down what you observed. This IS the `defaults` vs `vars` distinction in action.
  - Observation: `vars/main.yml` wins over `group_vars`, `host_vars`, and playbook `vars:` — but NOT over extra vars (`-e` flag) or `set_fact`. Extra vars (`-e`) are the only thing that always beats everything.

---

### 3. Role dependencies — `meta/main.yml`

- `dependencies:` — a list of other roles that must run before this role
- Ansible runs all dependencies automatically, in order, before the role itself
- `allow_duplicates: true` — but by default a role dependency only runs once per play
- Use case: a `common` role (NTP, firewall, base config) that every app role needs

**Exercise — Create a `common` role and make `webserver` depend on it:**

- Create `roles/common/` with a single task that prints `"Running common setup"`
- In `roles/webserver/meta/main.yml` add `dependencies: [{role: common}]`
  - It will run once when defined here.
- Run `site.yml`. Verify `common` runs BEFORE `webserver`, automatically, without you calling it in the playbook.
- Now also add `common` explicitly in `site.yml` too. Run again.
- Does `common` run twice? (It should NOT — that is `allow_duplicates: false`)
  - `It will not run twice even explicitly added until allow_duplicates: true`
- Add `allow_duplicates: true` to common's `meta/main.yml`. Run again. Does it run twice now?

---

### 4. Calling roles — three ways

- `roles:` list at the play level — static, runs before any `tasks:` in the play
- `import_role:` — static inline within `tasks:`, full tag support, no loops
- `include_role:` — dynamic inline, supports loops and runtime variable-based decisions
- Pass variables to a role using `vars:` when calling `import_role` or `include_role`

> **Syntax**: both `import_role` and `include_role` need a `name:` key — they are not shorthand like `command: sleep 5`:
>
> ```yaml
> - import_role:
>     name: webserver
>
> - include_role:
>     name: webserver
> ```

**Exercise — Call the same role three ways:**

> **Three separate plays** — do not put all three in one play. When `roles:` and `tasks:` exist in the same play, `roles:` always runs first, so you lose the ability to compare them independently. Each play should demonstrate only one calling style.

- Write `webservers.yml` with three separate plays:
  - Play 1: call `webserver` role using `roles:` list syntax only — no `tasks:` key in this play
  - Play 2: call `webserver` role using `import_role` inside `tasks:`, pass `http_port: 9090` via `vars:`
  - Play 3: call `webserver` role using `include_role` inside `tasks:`
- Add tags to the `import_role` call. Run with `--tags` — verify tags work on inner tasks.
  - Why: `import_role` is static — Ansible reads the role at parse time and copies the tag down to every inner task. So `--tags import` reaches all tasks inside the role even though they don't have the tag written in the role files.
- Add tags to the `include_role` call. Run with `--tags` — verify tags do NOT reach inside the role.
  - Why: `include_role` is dynamic — Ansible doesn't know what's inside at parse time, so the tag stays only on the include task itself. Inner tasks have no tag and get skipped. To filter inner tasks with `include_role`, you must put `tags:` on the tasks inside the role files directly.
- Loop over `include_role` with a list of role names. Verify the loop works.
- Try the same loop with `import_role`. Run. Read the error. Understand it.
  - ERROR! You cannot use loops on 'import_role' statements. You should use 'include_role' instead.

### 5. Role search path — where Ansible looks for roles

Ansible checks these paths in order (first match wins):

1. `./roles/` directory next to the playbook file (most common)
2. `~/.ansible/roles/` — user-level install location
3. `/etc/ansible/roles/` — system-wide location
4. `roles_path` in `ansible.cfg` — custom paths, can be a list

**Exercise — `ansible.cfg` roles_path:**

- Create `ansible.cfg` at the root of `03_Roles_Reusability/`:

```ini
[defaults]
roles_path = ./roles
```

- Move your `roles/` directory one level deeper (e.g., into `custom_roles/`)
- Update `ansible.cfg` to point to it. Run `site.yml`. Verify it still works.

---

### 6. Ansible Galaxy — requirements.yml

- `ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.nginx` — install a role from Galaxy
- `requirements.yml` — pin exact versions so installs are reproducible across environments
- `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml` — install everything at once

**Exercise — requirements.yml:**

- Create `requirements.yml` that installs `geerlingguy.git` from Galaxy
- Run `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`
- Open the installed role. Read its `defaults/main.yml`
- Count how many configurable variables it exposes — that IS the `defaults` pattern in action
- Read its `tasks/main.yml` — understand how it splits tasks across multiple files

---

## Break stuff on purpose

- Delete `tasks/main.yml` from your webserver role. Run the playbook. What error?
- Put a variable in `vars/main.yml` with the same name as one in `group_vars/all.yml`. Run. Observe which wins. Swap it to `defaults/main.yml`. Run again. Which wins now?
- Add a circular dependency: `webserver` depends on `common`, `common` depends on `webserver`. Run it. What does Ansible say?
- Call `include_role` with a variable role name and leave the variable undefined. Run. Read the error. Then define it. Run again.

## Mini Project — Multi-Role Web Application Setup

Build a project that simulates deploying a two-tier app using multiple roles.

**Requirements:**

- **Role 1: `common`** — runs on all hosts, sets up base configuration

  - `defaults`: `ntp_server: "pool.ntp.org"`, `timezone: "UTC"`
  - Tasks: print `"Setting timezone to {{ timezone }}"`, print `"Configuring NTP: {{ ntp_server }}"`
- **Role 2: `webserver`** — depends on `common`

  - `defaults`: `http_port: 80`, `document_root: "/var/www/html"`
  - `vars`: `nginx_worker_processes: "auto"` (this should NOT be overridable externally)
  - `tasks/install.yml`: print `"Installing nginx"`
  - `tasks/configure.yml`: print `"Configuring nginx on port {{ http_port }}"`, notify handler, render `nginx.conf.j2` to `/tmp/`
  - `handlers`: `"nginx config changed"` handler
  - `templates/nginx.conf.j2`: a minimal fake nginx.conf using `http_port` and `document_root`
- **Role 3: `app_deploy`** — depends on `common`

  - `defaults`: `app_version: "1.0.0"`, `deploy_path: "/opt/app"`
  - Tasks: print `"Deploying version {{ app_version }} to {{ deploy_path }}"`
- `site.yml` calls all three roles
- Override `http_port` to `8080` via `group_vars` for the webservers group
- Override `app_version` to `"2.1.0"` via a `vars:` block when calling `app_deploy`
- Verify through debug output that both overrides actually took effect

**Stretch goals:**

- Add `requirements.yml` that installs one real role from Galaxy alongside your custom roles
- Add a task in `webserver` that uses `files/` to copy `index.html` to `/tmp/`
- Call `app_deploy` in a loop for versions `["1.0.0", "2.0.0", "3.0.0"]`

**Files to create:**

- `03_Roles_Reusability/roles/common/`
- `03_Roles_Reusability/roles/webserver/`
- `03_Roles_Reusability/roles/app_deploy/`
- `03_Roles_Reusability/site.yml`
- `03_Roles_Reusability/requirements.yml`
